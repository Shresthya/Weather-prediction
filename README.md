Weather Prediction using Machine Learning
Repository: Shresthya/Weather-prediction
Technologies: Python, scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

ðŸŒ¦ Overview
This project implements a machine learning-based weather prediction model that forecasts weather conditions using historical meteorological data. The goal is to explore patterns and build a regression/classification model capable of predicting temperature or weather type with high accuracy.

ðŸ§  Key Features
ðŸ“Š Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and processed real-world weather datasets.
ðŸ§ª Model Training: Trained ML models such as Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Decision Trees.
ðŸ“ˆ Performance Metrics: Evaluated using metrics like accuracy, RMSE, and RÂ² score.
ðŸ“‰ Visualization: Used Matplotlib and Seaborn to visualize trends and correlations.

ðŸ”® Future Improvements
Incorporate deep learning models for time-series forecasting (e.g., LSTMs).
Extend to real-time prediction using live weather APIs.
Add a web dashboard for interactive predictions and visualizations.
